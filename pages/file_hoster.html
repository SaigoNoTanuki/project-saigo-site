                Download the file, Extract it. <br>
                pass: THE-ONEPIECE-IS-REAL <br>
                Once downloaded open pLauncher. You will need to add a custom server. <br>
                The custom server (16 player) file is located at: <br>
                Phasmophobia_Data\Plugins\x86_64 <br>
                If the files happen to be broken...... Teehee ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ.
                Note: The purpose of this is to allow you to play with mods as the current version doesn't allow them. <br>
                So support the devs by buying the game when you can. <br>
