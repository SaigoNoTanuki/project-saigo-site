            <h3 class="manga-anime-para-1">
                I definitely prefer the manga over the anime. There are a bunch of stuff in the manga that <br>
                didn't make the cut for animation.This goes both ways however, as the anime also has stuff <br>
                that the manga doesn't, The movies for example. I could go on and on about how the pacing sucks <br>
                and Toei is inconsistent with the source but let's not go there. <br><br>
                For One Piece I watch the anime on One Pace, One Pace is a fan made edit of One Piece that fixes the issue with pacing. <br>
                Ofcourse this doesn't work for the latest episodes tho, For the latest ones I use Pahe. <br><br>

                For manga I read the TCB Fan translations on Comick. Their translations are really good and pretty fast. <br>
                Coimick is a great site to read manga however they don't have the original Japanese versions for whatever reason. <br><br>

            <h2 class="arc-1">Marine-Ford</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-2">
                Marineford is a great arc, This arc along with a few before it set up the introduction for haki; a power system <br>
                within the One Piece world. This arc also gives us Luffy's lore, how he grew up, and why he decided to be a pirate. <br>
                along side this we also get lore around Gold Roger, The pirate king and Portgas D. Ace. This arc does a great job <br>
                introducing a new power system, lore around the characters and the level that the crew needs to be at to survive the <br>
                New World (Latter half of the grand-line).

            <h2 class="arc-2">Wano Kuni</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-3">
                Wano Kuni is the longest anime arc. Wano Kuni has exceptionally beautiful visuals and some of the greatest fights. <br>
                This arc marks the end of the story for Momonosuke and the Kozuki clan and is also the last arc before the ending saga <br>
                of the series. This arc also gives us important lore on Gold Roger and Edward Newgate (White Beard). I in particular love <br>
                Wano Kuni Act 3: Attack on Onigashima.

            <h2 class="arc-3">Impel Down</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-4">
                Impel Down is the arc leading up to Marine-Ford. Impel Down shows Luffy taking on a big challange on his own for the first <br>
                time. This arc also re-introduces the GOAT Bon Clay. I can't do this arc any justice by explaing it in my own words, So I'll <br>
                just leave it at that.

            <h2 class="arc-4">Sabaody Archipelago</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-5">
                This arc does a great job in showing the stakes of the next part of the journey. In this arc Luffy and his crew loose for the <br>
                first time and are force to seperate. This arc shows the skill cap to entering the New World and how weak Luffy actually was <br>
                compared to his foes. This arc also shpws how disgusting the world of One Piece truly is. It shows the extremely prevalent racism, <br>
                slavery, and hier-archy based discrimination all around and how the World Govt. is willing to not only turn a blind eye to it but <br>
                also facilitate it.

            <h2 class="arc-5">Arlong Park</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-6">
                Arlong Park is widely considered by a lot of people as the point where "the story gets good". I personally do not agree, i think <br>
                the story is great from the start. This arc is the first show the racism of this world in play. I don't have much to say about this arc.

            <h2 class="arc-6">Amazon Lily</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-7">
                Amazon Lily is a very underrated arc. It's the first time that Luffy's without his crew in the story. This arc does a great job in <br>
                showcasing the role of every Strawhat member and how important each role is. He can't eat without Sanji, Navigate without Nami, <br>
                treat himself without Chopper etc.

            <h2 class="arc-7">Ennies Lobby</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-8">
                Ennies Lobby is an amazing arc. It's hard to put it all in words so I'll just leave it at you have to experience it yourself.

            <h3 class="arcs-para-9">
                This hasn't been animated yet, but from what I've seen so far it's one of my favorites. Since it hasn't been animated I won't describe it.

            <h2 class="arc-9">Whole Cake Island</h2>
            <h3 class="arcs-para-10">
                This arc is Luffy's first encounter with a Emperor other than White Beard. This arc gives us lore on Sanji, the Vinsmoke family <br>
                and sets up future fights. In this arc Luffy as a captain is challanged for the 3rd time. This arc tells a great story and <br>
                introduces some truly amazing character building
